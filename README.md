# Hunter Chang

This is the personal website of Hunter Chang. I wanted a simple "Link in Bio" type of website, like Linktree, but also wanted it to look and feel like TikTok and Instagram Reels.

You can watch this companion video for more info about the code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZnrp8GvDko

To get started, install the node packages:

```
npm install
```

Get the Browser Sync watcher going:

```
npm run dev
```

In a new terminal tab, get the Tailwind CSS watcher going:

```
npm run dev-tailwind
```

To build and minify the final Tailwind CSS file, you can optionally run:

```
npm run build
```
